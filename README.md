# registration_extras

Python module to run ANTs registration.

## convert_dicom_to_nifty.py

### Input

Input folder full of dicom directories.
The dicom files contain the scan, structure set and dose.
These files are all in the same directory, but a unique directory for each patient fraction


### Processing

Converts RT struct, RT dose and the scan image for each patient fraction.
These are converted to Nifty (nii.gz) to work with the ANTS registration software.

### Command line usage

```
usage: convert_dicom_to_nifty.py [-h] [-v] input output

Dicom conversion utility. Convert from dicom to nifty

positional arguments:
  input          Directory containing patient folders
  output         Output location for nifty files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  increase verbosity (default: False)
```


## Road map

Note: ðŸš§ = Under construction (not yet implemented).

* Convet a folder of dicoms to niftys as this is required for ANTS to run. ðŸš§
* * Scans ðŸš§
* * Dose ðŸš§
* * Structures ðŸš§
* Compute ANTS registration on the folder of nifty scans ðŸš§
* Run computed ants registration on: 
* * Images - To allow for visual inspection and compute mutual information ðŸš§
* * Dose - To allow dose summation (giving hopefully more accurate dose to each organ) ðŸš§
* * Structures - To allow evaluation of registration accuracy by computing resultant segmentation metrics such as dice or hd. ðŸš§
* Sum dose - Performed on dose files and giving a resultant dose for each patient. ðŸš§
* Compute metrics - Compute segment metrics on the original contour and transformed (registered) contours. ðŸš§
* Compute jacobian - Another image which displays characteristics of the deformation field (did any local regions fold?) ðŸš§
* Compute MI - Mutual information - Could give an indication if the registration was performed successfully. ðŸš§
